				Our organization is a family farm, which was founded 21 years ago by two brothers and continues to grow every year with 80 hives. And throughout this period we have been trying to keep the bar of quality and price, so that everyone can afford quality honey. 
			</p>	
			<p>
				Our apiary is a truck and trailer with hives, which moves around Kyrgyzstan in search of the best fields and meadows, we travel to Naryn, Issyk-Kul, Osh, and the house is located in the Chui Valley where the process of honey harvesting also takes place. Every year we get about 3-4 types of honey from these regions.

			<p>
				The process of collecting honey is very complicated and long, throughout the summer our family is away from home and works hard. Everything starts with moving, hives weighing from 40 kg each are loaded on a truck and transported to the fields with flowers, then after a certain period of time begins the process of collecting honey. And after all these complicated procedures you get the final product - <b>our wonderful honey.</b>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="lastParagraph">
			<p>
				I would also like to enlighten people about the choice of honey. Quality honey thickens very quickly because there is little moisture, and moisture is a breeding ground for bacteria. So you should choose thick honey in the off-season, pure liquid honey is not available in October. It is either melted honey that loses its useful properties during processing, or surprisingly sugar honey, it does not thicken at all. So do not be afraid of granular honey, it is just the best quality product. Also demand a certificate of quality of the product, honest people have nothing to hide!
