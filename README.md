### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have been busy creating a website for a long time and have encountered some difficulties. I study at the Faculty of Economics and I am confident with a computer, but web design has become a novelty for me
and caused a lot of difficulties, in many ways the layout skill depends on practice and it was not enough throughout the course, so the site turned out to be not perfect, there was a more colorful concept in my head,
but overall I am satisfied with the work done so how in just a semester I was able to make my own website.
	The site is an online store that houses products from my family's apiary, so I chose this theme. This site can be very useful for my business,
but you need to add working functions so that you can use it, for this you will need to make a Backend of the site. The main page contains information about my company, its history
, information about me and many photos that complement the picture of our company. There is also a guide on how to choose high-quality honey on store shelves. 
On the left there is a navigation menu with which the main difficulties arose, since we did not learn Java scripting in the lessons and had to look for ways to implement this concept for a long time. 
There is also a catalog of products, all products are highlighted when you hover the cursor.Below are links to social networks, email and phone number.
